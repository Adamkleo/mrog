# mrog

A Mathematical language inspired by Wolfram Alpha-inspired & Mathprog, written in Python.

Currently working on correctly tokenizing, parsing and evaluating expressions with error handling support. Derivatives now support single and multi-variable functions as well as matrix-valued functions.

## Features to be Added
- [x] Built-in functions
- [x] Matrices
- [x] Multi-variable functions
- [ ] TBD
  

## Dev notes
- [ ] Add factorial to variables and paren expressions
- [ ] Improve error handling
